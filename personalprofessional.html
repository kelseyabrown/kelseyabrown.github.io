            <h1>Personal and Professional</h1>
            <h3>Professional</h3>
            <p>I am currently a social media intern at the <em>University of Florida Hillel</em>, a Jewish organization right off campus across from the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. I am in charge of the <a href="http://ufhillel.org" target="_blank">@ufhillel Instagram</a>. I am responsible for posting images with captions almost everyday about various topics and events. </p>
            <p><img src="img/ocean.jpg" width="400" title="ocean" alt="ocean" /></p>
            <h4>What's Next?!</h4>
            <p>I hope to use my social media skills in the future after I graduate. I would love to be a social media manager for a sports team or if that doesn't work out, I would not mind finding some area of expertise in media sales/advertising.</p>
            <h3>Personal</h3>
            <P> I have many personal interests. My favorite interest is in sports, with a focus on football. I grew up watching/attending football games so it is one of my favorite activites. I like other sports as well and keep up with the latest sports news and scores of games. Add photo of me at sporting event? </P>
