            <h2>Professional</h2>
            <p>I am currently a social media intern at the <em>University of Florida Hillel</em>, a Jewish organization right off campus, across from Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. I am in charge of the <a href="http://ufhillel.org" target="_blank">@ufhillel Instagram</a>. I am responsible for posting images with captions almost everyday about various topics and events. I use an application called "Afterlight" which helps me enhance photos and add borders so that the photos are optimized for the Instagram application. </p>

            <h4>What's Next?!</h4>
            <p>I hope to use my social media skills in the future after I graduate from UF. I would love to be a social media manager for a sports team or if that doesn't work out, I would not mind finding some area of expertise in media sales/advertising.</p>
            <h2>Personal</h2>
            <P> In addition to the interests I described on my about me page, there are still a couple more I would like to discuss in detail. My favorite interest is in sports, with a focus on football. I grew up watching/attending football games so it is one of my favorite activites. I like other sports as well and keep up with the latest sports news and scores of games. My favorite teams are the Florida Gators, Miami Heat, and the Miami Dolphins. </P>

            <h4> Reading </h4>
            <P>If I am not busy watching/attending a sporting event, taking photos, or listening to music, I probably have my nose in a book. I have grown to love reading any genre, with my latest obsession being mysteries. <em>Gone Girl</em> has become one of my favorites. Other books that I consider "must-reads" are <em>Perks of Being a Wallflower</em>, <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>, <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Hunger Games</em> and <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>.</P>
