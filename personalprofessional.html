            <h1>Personal and Professional</h1>
            <h2>Professional</h2>
            <p>I am currently a social media intern at the University of Florida Hillel, a Jewish organization right off campus across from the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. I am in charge of the @ufhillel instagram. I am responsible for posting images with captions almost everyday about various topics and events. </p>
            <h3>Personal</h3>
            <P> I have many personal interests. My favorite interest is in sports, with a focus on football. I grew up watching/attending football games so it is one of my favorite activites. I like other sports as well and keep up witht the latest sports news and scores of games. </P>
            <p>Another interest of mine is music. I cannot imagine going a day without listening to my favorite singers and bands.</p>
