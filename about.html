            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>Kelsey</h3>
            <p> My name is Kelsey Brown. I grew up in Miami my whole life before moving to Gainesville for college. I am twenty-one years old and currently a senior at the University of Florida, majoring in Telecommunications with a track of media and society. I hope to graduate in either spring 2015 or summer 2015.Moving to Gainesville was quite a change from a big city like Miami, where it is isn't uncommon to hear Spanish spoken in many public places and a popularity activity includes boating or going to the beach. I learned to adjust and now I love it here at UF. The sports aspect of the university certain caught my eye.</p>

            <p>One interest of mine that I'm starting to notice that I love to do is photography. Even with a camera as simple as an iPhone, I love taking photos wherever I go and editing them as well. Adjusting saturation, clarity etc are all exciting to me so I can post my favorite photos. Add photo here.</p>

            <p>An interest of mine is music. I cannot imagine going a day without listening to my favorite singers and bands. My favorite singers/bands at the moment are Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift,  Luke Bryan, and Mumford and Sons.</p>
